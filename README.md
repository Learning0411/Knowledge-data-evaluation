# Knowledge-data-evaluation
A high-efficiency data management tool designed for analyzing entity relationships and comprehensively evaluating data quality.
## Overview
This system leverages advanced algorithms to evaluate data quality across multiple dimensions, including quantity, consistency, and association, providing a clear view of data quality to assist users in optimizing datasets.

## Configuration
Before running the system, you may need to configure the path to your own `bert-base-chinese` model in `similarity_computation.py`. Replace the default path with the path to your local model directory.
